\title{neuron: class to represent traced neurons}
\description{
  neuron objects consist of a list containing multiple
  fields describing the 3D location and connectivity of
  points in a traced neuron. The critical fields of a
  neuron, n, are n$d which contains a dataframe in SWC
  format and n$SegList which contains a representation of
  the neuron's topology used for most internal
  calculations. Useful functions include plot.neuron
  plot3d.neuron write.neuron read.neuron
