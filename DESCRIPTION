Title: NAT: Wrapper for informal neuroanatomy AnalysisSuite codebase
Version: 0.6.1
Author: Greg Jefferis
Maintainer: Greg Jefferis <jefferis@gmail.com>
Description: This package is a thin wrapper around the AnalysisSuite
    (https://github.com/jefferis/AnalysisSuite) bundle of R code that I have
    been using for a number of years to analyse and visualise 3D biological
    image data, especially traced neurons. The idea is that this will
    immediately make it rather easier to install AnalysisSuite and that over
    time it should be possible to migrate many of the AnalysisSuite functions
    (currently in a loose bundle of R source code files and associated data)
    into formal R packages.
    AnalysisSuite provides functions to read/write a variety of 3D image
    formats including Amira, NRRD and Biorad PIC and can interact with the
    CMTK and IRTK image registration suites. There is read/write functionality
    for neuron tracings including SWC, Amiramesh (lineset and skeletonize),
    Neurolucida ASC. These data can then be visualised (including in 3D via
    rgl) or analysed including applying calculated registrations from image
    data to neuron tracings. There is also some recent functionality for
    representing image data for neurons that have been skeletonised but not
    formally traced. This representation also allows morphological comparison
    with neurons including searches/clustering.
